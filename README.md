# weather-dashboard
Server-Side API Build

## Description

This aim of this project waas to create an online conding quiz using HTML, CSS, JS, and Web APIs. This is a timed quiz, cycling through an array of questions, which stores the user's high score (the amount of time left at the end of the quiz). Not only did this quiz allow me to further refine the skills learned previously with HTML, CSS, and JS, but also allowed me to implement new skills learned throughout the Web APIs module. The quiz questions themselves revolve around Javascript and will be used for interview prep. Throughout this project, I learned about local storage, timers, debugging, and was able to further practice loops and linking functions.

The aim of this project was to create a weather dashboard responsive to user city searches and provide a five-day weather forecast for that city. This
