# weather-dashboard
Server-Side API Build

## Description

The aim of this project was to create a weather dashboard responsive to user search input and provide both current and five-day weather forecasts for that city. User input searches save via local storage and persist once the page refreshes. This assignment allowed me to further my work with server-side APIs, JS, CSS, and HTML. Throughout this project I was able to learn to use AJAX and JQuery to call specific information from an API to display on the webpage. This can also be done using a fetch function, but I personally had more experience using AJAX and JQuery and opted for this method.
